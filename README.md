EasyCall
========

This is a simple Android app for my mother to help her utilize the "smart" phone I bought her.
With this app, she can send text messages or make phone calls within two clicks.

Main functions:
1. click to make phone calls to target phone.
2. edit target phone number.
3. select short message template from spinner, click to send.
4. add/delete short messages.

Additional functions:
1. check phone this.phone.number and this.phone.IMEI at start. If this.phone.number changed,
reactivition is required; if this.phone.IMEI changed, quit after a alerting dialog.
2. set app background paper randomly at runtime.
3. flip screen to change background paper.
4. long press screen to set app background paper as phone wall paper.
